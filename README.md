# Enhancing Software Security with Collaborative LLM-Based Agents

This project demonstrates a framework combining multiple GPT-4-based agents to automate secure code generation, vulnerability analysis, and iterative security refinement. It also evaluates the quality of generated code using the CoNaLa dataset and BLEU score.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Components

- **Code Generation Agent (CGA)**: Uses GPT-4 to generate Python code from natural language descriptions.
- **Vulnerability Analysis Agent (VAA)**: Analyzes the generated code using Bandit to detect security vulnerabilities.
- **Security Enhancement Agent (SEA)**: Uses GPT-4 to automatically fix vulnerabilities while preserving the codeâ€™s functionality.
